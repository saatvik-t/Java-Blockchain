# Java Blockchain

This Java program demonstrates a simple implementation of a blockchain using SHA-256 for hashing. The blockchain is a distributed and immutable data structure commonly used for secure data storage and integrity verification in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.


## Features

- The blockchain is implemented as a series of connected blocks, where each block contains data and a reference (hash) to the previous block.
- This chain-like structure ensures the integrity of the data, as changing the content of any block would invalidate all subsequent blocks.
- The block class represents an individual block in the blockchain.
- SHA-256 is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value.
- The applySha256 method uses the SHA-256 algorithm to compute the hash of a given input string.
